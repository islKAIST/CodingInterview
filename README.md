# Coding_Interview

Thank you for applying to ISL!

The purpose of this interview is to test your programming skills.

1. You are given one week (7 days) to perform a programming subject.

2. The subject can vary: from reproducing a specific paper to making a free program that you want.

3. Please upload the code on your personal github repository.

4. After that, a coding interview will be done by lab members. Don't worry! If you understand your code, there will be no problem!

5. Other repos and codes can be used freely,Â but clear citations are required!
